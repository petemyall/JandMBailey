  <h1>Day 1: From Heathrow to Hello Tokyo!</h1>

  <div class="description-box">
    <p>After months of planning, lists longer than a Shinkansen (🚄), and enough YouTube vlogs to qualify as “Japan experts,” we finally made it! Heathrow's Terminal 5 felt like a test of stamina: dodging queues, battling for a decent cup of tea, and snagging extra legroom seats like seasoned pros.</p>
    <p>The flight? Smooth as silk (thank you, Japan Airlines) with a surprisingly edible chicken teriyaki and a binge of “Lost in Translation” to set the mood. Upon landing at Haneda Airport, we were greeted by Japan’s famous efficiency: customs was a breeze, and we were officially on Japanese soil in record time.</p>
    <p>Jet lag? Oh yes. But adrenaline—and the promise of our first bowl of <em>ramen</em>—pushed us through. Our hotel in Asakusa is a blend of old and new, with <em>tatami</em> mats, a robotic check-in, and a bathroom panel that could launch a spaceship. Yes, we accidentally triggered the bidet. Twice.</p>
    <p>We strolled to Sensoji Temple just as the lanterns glowed. The street food—<em>taiyaki</em> (fish-shaped cakes filled with red bean), <em>yakitori</em> (grilled skewers), and the sweet, smoky scent of freshly grilled <em>mochi</em>—lured us like moths to a neon flame.</p>
    <p>After nearly 24 hours of travel and exploring, we collapsed into bed. Tomorrow? Sushi, sumo, and maybe a karaoke bar if we can keep our eyes open. Stay tuned!</p>
